The Offering




Turn at al-­Kathīb,
   friends, then pass
by Láʿlaʿi, in search
   of Yalámlam’s waters


There you’ll find
   those you’d known
My hajj is for them,
   my fast and feast


I’ll never forget
   Muhássab near Mína,
the field of sacrifice,
   or Zámzam’s spring


As if they cast
   live coals from my heart,
offered my soul,
   drank my blood!


When you come to Hājir,                       
   driver, halt
the camels there,
   shout forth a greeting

And call toward the red
   pavilions of Híma,
call out a greeting
   of longing and loss


If you hear back
   bear them blessings
and fond regards
   If not, journey on


To the river of ʿĪsā
   where their camels graze
and white tents nestle
   by the stream


Ring forth the names
   of Daʿd and Rabáb,
Záynab and Hind,
   Lúbna then Sálma


Then ask if there’s                          
   a girl at Hálba
who shows the sun
   in her smile

As Night Let Down Its Curtain




Peace, Sálma
   and peace to those
who halt at al-­Híma
   It’s right I greet you


Would it have hurt
   to return the greeting?
A lady of stone
   never responds


They left as night
   let down its curtain
Pity a lad, I said,
   dazed and forsaken


Hemmed in by longings,
   pierced by their arrows
on target always
   wherever he goes


She smiled, lightning                                           
   flashed, and I couldn’t
tell what it was
   that split the night

Harmony Gone




Yearning sought the highlands,
  consolation the plain
and here I’m stranded
  between Najd and Tihām


Opposites never
  to be joined—
Undone, unstrung
  Harmony gone


Where is my craft?
  What can I do?
Guide me, scold—don’t
  crush me with blame


Sighs ascend
  to the highest heavens,
tears streaming
  from my eyes


The red-­roans yearned                          
  for the meadows of home,
on cracked hooves racing
  like a crazed lover

Artemisia and Moringa




Patience and solace are gone—
   gone with those
who live within
   my heart’s dark core


I asked where they’d kneel
   their camels at noon
By the artemisia,
   I heard, and moringa


I asked the wind
   to track them to
the thicket’s shade
   where their tent wings spread


To bring them greetings
   from the slave of grief
His heart was torn
   when the tribe dispersed

Gowns of Dark




I touched the stone
      through a whirl of young women
circling the Káʿba,
      faces veiled


They lowered their veils,
      revealing the sun
Death stalks the
      gaze, they warned


Many’s the proud
      soul we’ve taken
questing at the threshold
      of Mína’s cairns


In the wádi courts,
      near the heights of Râm
and Jem, through the throngs
      on ʿÁrafa plain


See how beauty                                         
      plunders the chaste
“Spoiler of virtue”—
      so aptly named

We’ll meet at Zámzam
      after the circling,
by the middle tent,
      near the boulders


There a man starved
      by love’s fever
is cured by the scent
      of those who lured him


Roused, they loosen
      their hair and let it
fall, enfolding them-­
      selves in dark

Who Forever




Their spring meadows
   are desolate now
but desire for them
   lives on in the heart


      These are their ruins
         tears in memory
      of those who melt
         the soul forever


I called out, following,
   love-­dazed, after
You so full with
   beauty—I’ve nothing


      With desire maddened,
         I rubbed my face
      in the dust   By the
         right of true love


Don’t crush a man                           
   drowned in tears
yet aflame
   with ceaseless sorrow

Soft-­Eyed Graces




Lightning flashed
      in Abraqáyn
Thunder roared
      within our ribs


A fine rain fell
      on sand-­slipped hills,
quivering branches
      bending toward you


Streams gushing,
      soft winds fragrant,
doves in the boughs,
      tender new sprigs


They pitched their red
      tents between rivers
winding like snakes—
      and there they stood


Splendid as rising                                  
      suns, they were
Soft-­eyed graces
      Beyond compare

Gentle Now, Doves




Gentle now, doves
   of the sprigberry and
moringa, don’t add your
   sighs to my heart-ache


Gentle now, lest
   your sad cooing show
the love I hide,
   the sorrow I seal


In the evening I echo
   back, in the morning
echo the longing
   of the lovesick and lost


Spirits moan
   in the Gháda trees
bending branches over me
   as I pass away


Bringing yearning,                                
   heartbreak and ever
new twists of pain
   to try me

Who’s here for me
   in Jem and Muhássab,
at Tamarisk and
   camp Naʿmān?


Hour by hour they
   circle my heart
in rapture and graze
   each corner with a kiss


They swore they’d never
   change and vowed
Who dyes herself
   with henna’s unfaithful


A veiled gazelle’s
   an amazing sight,
her henna hinting,
   eyelids signaling


A pasture between                                
   breastbone and spine
Marvel, a garden
   among the flames!


My heart can take on
   any form
For gazelles a meadow
   A cloister for monks

Sunblaze




At Sálam and Híma’s
   cloister, gazelles
reveal the sun
   as marble statues


I observe the spheres,
   serve a basilica,
guard a garden
   jeweled with spring


Gazelle-­minder
   of the empty quarter,
astrologer, monk—
   is what they call me


The one I love is
   three though one
like the three they call
   a single being


Believe what I tell you,               
   friend, about Sunblaze
guiding gazelles
   circling the statues

Grief Between




A ringdove cooed
   A sad man yearned,
stirred by the echoing
   yearning and grief


At the sound of her cry,
   his eyes welled
like pools filling
   above a spring


She mourns her one
   and only: how deep
the loss of the only!
   I called


Back, as grief
   passed between us
I, revealed,
   she still hidden


At the sands of Ālij                       
   I felt love’s sting—
white tents on slopes
   Eyes wide open

   glances fatal
eyelids sheaths

I held back tears

hiding love from

Till the crow cawed
   gone! exposing
the wild love of a

The riders pressed,
   spurring the camels,
red-­roans beneath

As they cinched

the reins, I beheld
   death’s cords before me


In love’s fever
   distance is mortal
Finding her would
   ease the pain

Hadith of Love




Lightning flashed
   and he yearned for the East
Had it flashed from the West
   there he’d have turned


I burn for the lightning,
   the flash, not for this
or for some other
   piece of ground


The Eastwind brought us
   the word—from distraction
from rapture and sorrow
   from my disarray


From drunkenness, reason,
   longing and grief,
from the fire
   from my heart


The one you seek                                  
   is within your ribs
turned in each breath
   from side to side

Tell him I told them
   he’s the one
who lit the fire
   within my heart


To be with you now
   alone would quench it
If it rages, why
   blame my love?

Just a Flash




They left me between
   Utháyl and White Dune,
scattering tears
   and shouting fire!


My father’s life
   for the one I mourn,
in whom I disap-­
   peared parting


On his cheek a tinge
   of shyness, dawn
light whispering
   into dusk


Patience decamps,
   sorrow pitches
its tent and I am
   frozen in place


Who will guide me                          
   through the thrall
and throes of this
   unending love?

I’d ’ve concealed
   the anguish but tears
and bleary eyes
   gave me away


Just a glance?
   I ask but they say,
we hold back only
   out of compassion


Never will
   a glance release you
It’s only a flash
   crackling the night


I’ll never forget
   how they left for Ábraq
to the chants of guides
   chanting them on their way


Gone! cawed                                    
   the crows of departure
God curse every
   crow that caws!


Parting’s crow
   is but a camel
bearing your love
   swiftly away

They placed the howdahs
  on long-­stride camels,
full moons within curtains,
  statues of stone


O they’d return!
  or so they vowed
Beauty’s promise,
  delusion


They bid farewell
  with henna-­tipped fingers,
unloosed their tears
  yet stoked a fire


They set off for Yemen
  then turned toward
Khawárnaq then
  toward Sadīr


Damn it! I cried                                
  as they departed
If you want to cry
  damn it, they said

Why this single
   cry of damnation?
Damn it, damn it,
   damn it again!


Easy now, dove
   of the persica
thicket, departure
   has sharpened your cry


Your cooing stirs
   this lover,
inflaming a man
   already afire


It melts the heart,
   drives off sleep,
whets our longing,
   compounds our sighs


Death hovers                                
   in a dove’s cry
I ask remission
   if just for a time


May the Eastwind
   as it hails from Hājir
soothe us with
   a cooling rain

Yet your rain clouds
   fly further away


You, star shepherd,
   let’s drink by night
and you, lightning-­gazer,
   be my companion


And you, who
   sleep the night away
self-­entombed
   before you die


If only you’d loved                           
   a brave beauty
you’d have found
   what you desired


You’d be sharing wine
   with the ladies,
confiding in the sun,
   whispering with the moon

God Curse My Love




Slow down, red-­roan
   drivers, stop—
I’m worn out, broken,
   fallen behind


Whoa, stop,
   pull in the reins,
by God and by the
   pain and passion!


My spirit is willing
   but my legs are weak
Who’s here for me now
   with help and cheer?


When the skilled craftsman
   finds his tools
of no avail—
   what can he do?


Look! Their tents                                
   are on the right
God bless you, wádi,
   for what you hold

As Cool as Life




Halt at the stations,
   grieve at the ruins,
then ask the meadows
   so desolate now


Where are those
   we loved and their roans?
Over there, cutting
   through the desert haze


They loom before you
   like a garden mirage—
large silhouettes
   in the mist


They’ve gone in search
   of al-­ʿUdháyb
to drink at its waters
   cool as life


I tracked after them,                            
   asking the Eastwind
Did they pitch their tents
   or find lote’s shade?

   at Drifting Sands,
their camels groaning
   through the night journey


They lowered a curtain
   over the flaps
of their tents, sheltering
   beauty from the sun


So set off, friends,
   in their tracks
on amber camels
   pacing in pursuit


Halt near the waymarks
   of Hājir, then
cross its canyons
   and ascend its ridge


As you near them                                 
   a fire will flare
before you and
   ignite your longing


Kneel your camels
   Don’t fear their lions
In desire’s fire
   they’ll look like cubs

The Tombs of Those Who Loved Them




O windswept ruin at Utháyl
      where I would play
             with lissome girls
who knew discretion


Yesterday, it embraced us
      laughing      Today
             it frowns
in desolation


They left as if
      I’d no clue
             Little did they know
my eye within


Could see and follow them
      to their encampment—
             it might’ve been me
leading their camels—


Until they halted                                                       
      in the Barrenlands
             spread their tents
and unfurled their carpets

In a Bad Way




I’m in a bad
   way, lost
in the languor
   of her eyes


Say her name
   and heal me—
Recalling her’s
   my only cure


Doves rustled
   in the green, cooing,
sad with the same
   sadness that’s mine


My father’s life!
   His life for a girl
walking proud
   among the wives


In my eyes she
   rose like the sun
then set aglow
   on my heart’s horizon

O ruins in Râma,                         
   wasted now—
what splendor
   you once beheld!


My father’s life
   my own! for
a gazelle browsing
   within my ribs


What burns for her
   there is light
and only light
   can quell this fire


Take the reins,
   friends, as traces
of her camp emerge
   before my eyes


When we arrive
   at that place
dismount and weep
   for me there


Support me then                         
   or try, even
as I face mis-­
   fortune alone

Love struck—
   without an arrow,
without a spear
   she put me away


Tell me again
   as I stand there weeping
will you stay
   by my side?


Remind me of Hind
   and of Lúbna,
Suláyma, Záynab
   and ʿInān


And what transpired
   at Zarūd and Hājir
and out in the wilds
   among gazelles


Then sing my loss                            
   with the verse of Qays
and Láyla, Máyya
   and stricken Ghaylān


Long is my longing
   for a young girl—
harmony in verse,
   in prose, in oration

For the daughter of kings,
   of Persian shahs,
of the city of cities,
   Isfahân


For a daughter of Irâq,
   my master’s child
and I, of Yemen,
   her foil


Did you know, my lords,
   have you heard
that contraries could
   ever be joined?


Had you only seen us                        
   in Râma trading
passion’s chalice—
   not moving a hand


As love sang
   a rapture song
between us
   without a sound


You’d have seen
   what melts the mind—
Irâq and Yemen
   intertwined!

O garden of the riverbed
respond to the lady
of this hallowed ground,
she with the flashing


Smile   Cover her
in shade for a while
until the assembly
gathers by her side


And their tents nestle
along the banks
Then dew and rain
will moisten branches


As they sway
Mists will shroud
the moringa tree
at dawn and eve


Then the shade                         
will start to deepen
from boughs laden
low with fruits

Blacksilver




Turn toward the hard
rock plain of Tháhmad
where willows and meadows
   are moist with dew


Where lightning flickers
before you and clouds
come early and
   by dusk are gone


Lift your voice
at the break of dawn
and call to each radiant
   lissome girl


Fatal the blacksilver
flash of her eyes,
gentle the bend
   of her neck as she turns


She hunts after                             
the heart-­dazed lover
laying him low
   with a glance of steel

She extends you a hand
soft as undyed silk
anointed with
   ambergris and musk


She casts you the gaze
of a fawn gazelle
a glint of obsidian
   in her eyes


A collyrium of spells
across her brow,
neckline ablaze
   with beauty unheard


How slender she is,
not loving as I
do, nor true
   to her vow


She lets down her hair’s                 
black coils to
fix with dread
   one who’d track her


It isn’t by God
my death I fear
but to die and
   never see her

Blaze




By dawn’s edge they’d cut
   through every ravine
to kneel their camels
   in Wādilaqīq


At first pale light
   it appeared
high above them
   on a mountain peak


It towers beyond
   the eagle’s glide,
cliff-­buzzard’s eggs
   nestled in its shadows


On great foundations
   it rises heavenward,
decked and blazoned
   like Castle ʿAqūq


On its walls they carved             
   a tale for the telling
and left it: Pity
   the love-­lost stranger

   then was ground
underfoot like
   an ember


Who staked his home
   in Aquila’s stars,
then sank drowning
   through his tears


Here in this place
   love turned him over
without a friend
   to the twisting fates


You who come down
   to Old Well,
you who find home
   in Wādilaqīq


You who search                      
   for sweet Medina,
you treading this

Revive me! Dawn
   then dusk and I


was robbed of a tender

  as a willow touched
by the wind, as anemone
  petals part silken


With a sway of the hips
  like the sway of a dune
or the hump of a camel mare
  ambling in the haze


If you shame me, scold,               
  for loving her,


if you shame me, friend,
  I’ll answer with a gasp


Longing’s my mount
  solitude’s my mantle,
my dawn wine’s delirium,
  tears are for dusk

Stay Now




A dervish recited a verse to me, the likes of which I’d never heard.


All who sought you
you showered with graces
Only for me did your
lightning flash faithless


It struck me and I followed its trail. I’ve composed verses using his
rhyme, quoting his verse in full, as a response to that dervish, God rest
his soul.


Stay at the ruins
in Láʿlaʿi fading,
and in that wilderness
grieve for those we loved


And at that campsite
call out her name,
your heart softly
torn away


O for the times
passed near her moringa,
picking her fruit,
her garden’s red rose




                                                             Stay Now

All who sought you
you showered with graces
Only for me did your
lightning flash faithless


We used, she said,                     
to come there together
in my branches’ shadows
in that lush land


My lightning, once
a smile’s flash,
is now a blaze
of barren stone


Blame time
relentless time!
What fault was it
of Láʿlaʿi?


I forgave her
as I heard her speak
grieving as I grieved
with wounded heart


I asked her when
I saw her meadows
pastures of the
scouring winds—

Vanished




Deep are the wounds and the rapture sharp
Love has ravaged me to the marrow


Yet by night a full moon shines
within my soul—musk and moon


And a branch on a dune,
so green and clear, so fragrant!


O how I loved the luster of his smile,
the nectar tasted in his kiss


A pale moon in sunset glow                             
on his cheek from behind a veil


Had he lowered the veil, he’d
have sharpened the pain   He let it be


She rose before me like a midday sun,
a branch on a dune become a garden


In fear I kept vigil, watering
that garden with a bursting sky


In wonder I behold her rise,
then, as she sets, I expire

Beauty laced the strands of her hair                        
in a gold tiara, gilding my fever

Had Iblīs seen her glow on Adam
he’d ’ve fallen down in prayer

Had Idrīs seen the mark of beauty
on her cheek, he’d ’ve written no more

Had Bilqīs seen her carpet
Sulaymân’s hall would’ve slipped her mind

O sarh tree of the valley, moringa, tamarisk
send your fragrance on the Eastwind

A scent of musk, and a breath                               
of the lowland and highland blossoms

Moringa of the riverbed, show me
a bough or wreath soft as her shoulder

The Eastwind tells of a time made young
at Hājir, Mína, or at Qúba

By the trail-­bend dune not far from Híma,
at Láʿlaʿ where gazelles graze

O do not do not do not wonder
at an Arab flirting with a beauty of the sands

When the turtledove cries lost love—                        
he’s gone

Vintage of Adam




Near the rock plain
   at Trail’s Bend
our camels will kneel
   by home waters


There’s no need to seek
   anywhere after
or call for Bāriq
   Tháhmad or Hājir


Revel like pert-­
   breasted girls
or gazelles that pause
   to graze then wander


While a fly murmurs
   in the meadow
and a songbird trills
   in answer


The garden fringe,                          
   breeze tender,
dark cloud glowing,
   thunder rumbling

  like the tears of a lover
torn apart from
  the one he loves


Drink this ancient
  wine, drink deeply
Let the song’s

Adam’s vintage
  bearing word
down the gener-­

This wine, scented
  with musk,
savored on the lips

Old Shrine




To you, old shrine,
   high above,
a light beckons
   from my heart


O the long,
   empty reaches
I’ve crossed, tears
   my messengers


Morning and evening
   I ride without rest
roping dawn to
   dusk to dawn


The camels stride
   through the night,
hoof-­bruised and lame,
   hard-­striding


They bear me to you                    
   in longing, without
desire of ever
   arriving there

No New Moon Risen




Between Náqa and Láʿlaʿ
Ájran gazelles


Graze the hillsides,
in a covert, hidden


No new moon rises
on that horizon


Without me wishing
it wouldn’t dare


Nor does the bare                             
stone desert flash


Without me fearing
our exposure


May these eyes
pour tears forever


Sighs rise heavenward,
heart shatter!


Slowly now, driver,
my ribs burn




                          No New Moon Risen

I wept and wept                                       
at the thought of their leaving


And now they’re gone
I can give no more


Journey to the swale
of the twisting dune


Where they graze
where I lie fallen


There by Ájran waters
are those I love


So tell of a man
left torn apart


Cast down in sorrow                                   
before the ruin


O hidden moon
take something from him


But leave him a glimpse
from behind the veil

For he couldn’t bear
to behold such beauty

And a potion of hope
to restore him to life


And to his senses
He is just a creature


Dead on the trail                                
between Náqa and Láʿlaʿ


Dead from despair,
dead from grief


Dead like me
in the place I stand


What the Eastwind promised
was illusion


When she led you to hear
what wasn’t spoken

I swear by my father’s
   life they sway
like boughs, strands
   along the cheeks


As their tresses
   gently fall
Soft and supple
   through shoulder and wrist


They walk forth trailing
   flirtatious pride
in gowns of luxuriant
   silken splendor


Cautious, they hold back
   their beauty but give
of their treasures freely,
   old and new


A laugh’s glamour,                         
   a welcoming smile,
the ambrosial elixir
   of a kiss

With modest veils
   over such beauty
as would ruin
   a God-­fearing man


O how their teeth

that would bring
   back the dead!


Their eyes’ arrows                  
   piercing the heart
of a man long-­

New moons rising
   from their bodices—
Once full they’ll

O my companions,

Wherever she gazes

Flanks gaunt
   hump hollowed
forces spent

I brought her to halt

Led by a moon
   of ghastly mien
I folded toward him

around him I turned,
   he around me


His footprints effaced

sand grouse shelter

Within a desert
  slashed by ravines

or might they be headed

I didn’t notice them
   saddling to leave—
Did my senses fail me
   or my attention?


It wasn’t this
   and wasn’t that
but a conflagra-­
   tion of desire


And O my cares—
   how you dispersed,
scattering after them
   like Sába’s lost tribes!


I call the fragrant
   winds as they pass:
Northwind, South,
   Sweet-­scented East!


Has news of us,                                         
   so weary and spent
in their absence,
   reached you?


The Eastwind brought
   the absinthe’s word
taken it in turn
   from the mountain flower

Whoever suffers
   love’s ills
hadiths of young
   passion may heal


Give us a word
   like the one given,
she said to the Northwind,
   or more wondrous still


And you, then, wind
   from the South,
bring news as sweet
   as mine or sweeter


I bring you, South                                        
   said, glad tidings
shared by the North
   and Southwest


All wrongs endured
   become graces,
all pain, if it pleases them,
   turns to pleasure


Till when and why
   do you lament
their leaving and
   count your wounds?

Whatever they promise
   you see in the lightning
only the flash
   of a rainless cloud


There on the fringe
   of dark, the cloud
wove a filigree
   of pure gold


Then sent tears                                         
   running along
its cheeks, then
   kindled a flame


Eyes as black
   as narcissi shone
and a rose appeared
   upon her cheek


If you seek it
   she will lower
her scorpion curls
   over her temples


The sun rises
   in her smile
How clearly, lord,
   her moist teeth shine!

Discerning the trace

Áda Trail




Lightning lit up Dhāt-­
al-­Áda, flashes shuddering
steep valley sides


A chain of rumbling
across the sky, then
thunder unleashed rains!


Kneel the camels! they shout
to all—but no one hears
Driver, I scream


Graze the camels!
For the love of a girl
in your care, a slender thing—


Soft her gestures, delicate                  
her walk—the heart of a
sad soul breaks


Mention her and we sigh
Every tongue
whispers her name

She makes her home on
a bald-­cap mountain
Were she camped below


Lowlands would rise
and the heights would soar
beyond the gaze


Every ruin, she brings
to life, she turns mirage
into quenching rains


With her, every garden                         
bursts into flower
All wine is pure


Her countenance illu-­
mines my night, dark
in the fall of her hair’s my day


The Sunderer split my
heart down center
when she let her arrows fly

With eyes adept at
finding their target
she buried the arrows inside

No turtledove either
No, not even a crow


Is more baleful

Fifty Years




Brought back to the prime
   of my life and youth
by words spoken
   between Hadītha and Karkh


After fifty years
   of hard thinking
I’ve become like
   a fledgling bird


Brought back to the folds
   of Splitrock and Hājir
back to the prime
   of my life and youth


When I led camels
   to Najd and Tihām
and lit for her a fire
   of flametree and markh

   with a dove
in a tangle thick

Tearlessly she
   mourns
her only one

I ask as my drown-­

the wreckage of
   my mind   What news


Do you have
   of those I love?
are they safe
   in branches’ shade?

quenched by the gentle

He greets you again

who has greeted you

And always returns
   to the beginning
and always begins
   again to return

Till evening’s flash

split me apart

Come Down to the Waters




Pass by al-­Híma,
   friends, in search
of Najd and its
   lonesome waymark


Come down to the waters
   at Twisting Sands
down to the lote shade
   and absinthe


When you reach
   Mína’s valley
you’ll be in the place
   that holds my heart


To all who arrive
   bring greetings
and blessings of peace
   on my behalf


Hearken to each                                        
   report that reaches you
and tell in turn
   of a haggard man

A Persian Girl




After Medina,
   Mecca and Jerusalem,
Baghdad’s God’s city
   I love the most


Why wouldn’t I
   love that city
of peace   My imām’s
   there to guide me


There lives a girl
   a Persian pearl
of delicate gesture
   and languid eye


Who kills with a glance
   then revives with a word
tempering fierce beauty
   with compassion

Day Falls Night




I’d give all I am
   for those ravishing girls
who teased me where
   we kissed the stone


When you lose yourself
   in their wake
a fragrant trace
   on the wind will guide you


When moonless night
   drags dark upon me
I recall them and walk
   bathed in light


When I ride with them
   in the falling dark
my night shines
   like the rising sun


I whispered love                                  
   to one of them,
a beauty far
   beyond compare

Odd to Even




Between Adhriʿāt
   and Búsra she appeared,
a girl of fourteen,
   full moon rising


In pride and glory
   she surpasses
the ebb and flow
   of time itself


Every moon
   when it waxes full
must wane again
   to complete its turn


But this moon runs
   through no constellations
and knows no doubling
   from odd to even


It’s you who bring                           
   each sweet fragrance
you, who give the
   spring its blossom

My Only Guide




God save that bird
high in a moringa


who called out the news
sharp and clear


that those I loved
had cinched their saddles


and set off by camel
at the break of dawn


leaving me, heart
afire, in their wake


In the moonless dark
I raced in pursuit


calling after,
close on their traces


tracking and tracking—                      
my only guide


a fragrant breath
on the wind of desire

When they lowered their veils
they lit the dark—


flooding the riders
in a sudden full moon


My tears rained down,
blocking the way


Since when, they asked,
does a river run here?


The tears, I say—
as they seek


and fail to cross it—
are endless   As


if the thunder
and lightning flares


and clouds roiling
in the pouring rain


were hearts beating,                            
the flash of a smile

and a burst of tears
for those gone away

Wise ones! Sign-­
   masters! I wander,
dazed, between
   Onyx and Oryx


Distracted, he
   who can’t see the sun,
not Súha, that faint
   horizon spark


Take him to offer
   his heart for his herd
Oblations open
   the throat in praise


She’s an Arab
   beauty and yet
pure Persian
   she is as well


Beauty composed her                        
   a harmony in pearl,
her teeth gleaming
   clear as crystal

She lowered her veil
   and a fearsome beauty
drew me toward her
   yet held me back


I’m the one
   with two deaths to die,
both told here
   in this Qur’an


Frightened by
   a lowered veil?
A battlefield’s
   a rising sun


My sanctuary,
   I said, is night’s
black curtain
   So let it fall


These verses have                           
   no rhyme, the sound
of her’s their only
   aspiration


She is the sign,
   the signification
Her for her’s
   my only offer

Parting’s Hour




I’ll never forget
Camp Wân and my word
to the riders leading
my love away


Stay a while
for by my love!
I need some respite
and time to heal


If they ride, let it be
with fortune
If they halt, let it be
on fertile land


I met them in Qánat
valley and stayed
with them from
Náqa to Arroyo


They tend to roans                         
grazing the pasture
but not to a lover
dazed and lost

Have mercy, driver,
on a young man
splitting bittergourd
at parting’s hour


One hand he clutches
to his chest
The other calms
a heart tearing free


As the saddle groans
Patience! they say,
but grief knows not
what this means


And if I’d ever
been under its sway
I’d have lost it
So what of me now?

Chimera




A full moon rises
   in the dark of her hair
Her eyes, black narcissi,
   moisten the rose


Other beauties
   in her flowering vanish
Her light darkens
   the light of the moon


More beautiful than
   all gazelles is she,
a form beyond
   all measure and form


The sphere of light
   turns at her feet
Her diadem gleams
   beyond the stars


If thought’s whisper                   
   might wound her
harsher still
   would be the gaze

Chimera—recall her
  and she’s gone—
too quick for thought
  or observation


Words would describe her
  but she rises
always just beyond
  and leaves them a’stammer


They’d place her
  but she steals away
leaving them baffled
  by her traces


Riders pursuing
  might ease their pace
but no one can ease
  a racing mind


All who love her                         
  she revives,
then takes beyond
  the bounds of mortal being


Unwilling to lavish
  her nectared kiss
on a would-­be lover
  in the mire

Where Gone




Where are my true loves now? By God
tell me where they’ve gone


I have seen their apparition
Show me their true form!


How long have I sought among them
asking where they are


To be assured in their presence
but in the end—never sure


Perhaps my star will intervene                     
twixt the here and far


My eyes rejoice, and my tongue
ask where O where no more

Cool Lightning



There’s a wrench in my gut
   and a tear in my eye—
      my heart rages between

Deep red are her lips,
   her kisses sweet as
      clear honey from bees

Her anklets entice like a cloud
   on a moon—sunset
      on her cheek, branch on a dune

Single and yet her
   bangles sparkle, cool
      lightning is her smile

She guards herself in earnest                           
   and in love she plays
      Death waits between

No night draws dark without
   the breath of dawn rising
      This we know of old

No wind from the East falls
   on a garden guarding maidens
      with budding breasts

Without stirring the leaves
   and wafting the perfume
      it gathers and passes on


I asked the Eastwind about them
   And who are you to want
      to know? she answered


I left them at Twin Flash—                               
   and at the relays of Ghimād
      and Ghamīm, close by


It’s said no land can hold them
   But they will never elude
      the cavalries of my longing


They hide in my soul
   and here where I am, look!
      the full moon rises


In my mind, then sets
   in my heart   Gone’s
      the curse of willow and moringa

And here where we dwell
   no crow can caw, ruing
      our embrace as one

The Turning




Moringa dove cooing
in Dhāt al-­Gháda—
no world can hold
your song


Who can bear
love’s sorrows
or down fate’s
bitter potion?


Heartsplit I cry,
O you who put me
through all this
will you care for me now?


He passed by
my door laughing,
hid his face
then turned away


It wasn’t his hiding                      
that hurt, no
It was the turning,
the turning away

Brave




Turn at Splitrock, driver, then halt
by the moringa in Mudárraj


Call out: Ladies, would you
grant us sweet release?


Near Râma, Hājir, and White Dune
a shy-­eyed girl rides in a palanquin


She lights the way like a lamp
for a man walking the night




Pearl in a shell of jet black hair—             
The mind dives after, sinking deep




Neck supple, gestures coquette,
like a gazelle of the shifting sands


Like the forenoon sun arcing
over Aries


When she lowers her veil, she covers
dawn in her morning light

I cried out between Híma and Râma,                 
Who’s here for a lad who halts and hopes


At Salʿ   For one in a desert maze,
haggard, haunted, forlorn?


For one drowned in his tears,
drunk on the wine of her open mouth?


For one burned in sighs,
lost in the glow between her eyes?


Desire’s hand played on his heart
Where is his crime?

In the Ruins of My Body




Who’ll show me her henna’d hand?
Who her honey’d tongue?


Such an enticing girl she is,
and in her beauty guarded well


Full moons on a flowering bough—
those like her will never fade


In the ruins of my body there’s
a garden dove high in a moringa


She dies longing, dissolved in desire,                             
stricken with what struck me


Her mate she mourns and blames time’s
arrow buried in both our hearts


The near are gone, home’s far away
Time has taken all that was


Who’s with me as she commends my pain
Before her, all my power fades

For a nightwalker
at Ma’zimáyn or Áda,
at Flashrock, Ridge
or Abraqáyn


There are swords
flashing through smiles
and pouches of musk
forbidden the senses


Resist and they’ll
unsheathe their glances
Give in and they
will shatter the chains


We took and they
took equal pleasure—
Kingdoms for the beloved
and for the lover

Happy the thought
   of Rídwa’s pastures
where the traveler finds
   cool waters and rest


My love’s party might
   have heard of the place,
kneeled camels there
   and encamped


Wherever they go
   my soul clings
as they chant
   their camels on


And when amid shouts
   they break toward desert
you can hear it
   howling on their trail


If they move toward Zawrā’              
   that’s where it leads them
If it’s Jawrā’ they seek
   it awaits them there

   wherever they camp
the bird follows
   For its chicks are there


Two fears ceaselessly
   vie within me,
fear for myself
   and fear for her


Lest her splendor
   shatter my gaze
and she be deafened
   by my sighs

Although our shapes

If I didn’t moan

Those suns, they tell us, are in Dār al-­Fálak
Beyond what heaven should a sun be set?


When the throne rests firm on its pillars,
the king has only to take his place


When the heart abandons its last delusion
it’s only an angel descending


I am his and he is mine
We belong to each other


I’m his, clearly, but is he mine?                                
Come to me now, he’s saying


Red-­roan driver, hold on!
Don’t miss the turn at Dār al-­Fálak


May a riverbank camp near Musánna cast
a spell on you and never let go


The love I’ve borne, the pain endured—
may the lord of desire put you through it


It wasn’t Zarūd, Hājir, or Sálam
that left you, lover, drawn as a ghost

Without him I die
   and with him’s no better
With or without him
   longing’s the same


I found him, finding

the cure and disease
   as equal fevers


His silhouette flares
   as we draw near
each other and
   burns more proud


The deeper the harmony
   the sharper the pain
Measure for measure
   as decreed

Baghdad Song




I long for Baghdād’s
   palace of the brave
not for the battlements
   of old Sindād


It crowns the gardens
   cascading below—
a virgin revealed
   in a perfumed chamber


The branches are stirred
   by the wind and bend,
lovers joined
   together at last


The river Tigris
   adorns her
Her lord’s our master
   imâm and guide—


Násir, Mansúr,                            
   best of the caliphs,
who never rode out
   for war

   long as a dove
on a bough coos
   and sways


Long as smiles
   flash lightning
my eyes responding
   like the morning rain


From a bride like
   the sun when the mists
part, unveiling
   herself in splendor

Red Rise




Eastwind fragrance, bring the gazelles of Najd
this word, that I, as they know me, am faithful


Tell the girl of the tribe we’ll meet early
Saturday morning, in the Najdian hills


Near the trail-­stone at the red rise
to the right of the flood beds and lonely ruin


If, as you say, it’s true that she suffers
the same desire as I do and burns


We’ll shade together in her tent                             
fulfilling the promise we made


We’ll tell of our longings, our tribulations
our trances, aches, and fevers—dream


stuff? signs from sleep bright with promise?
voice of a time that foretold my fortune?


May wishes’ shepherd lead them to day—
and her garden enclose me in roses

Is There a Way




Is there a way
   to those radiant graces,
a guide who’d track them
   to their place of rest


A haven from midday
   sun in the shade
of the persica by
   those tents near the dune?


A voice within
   told me her answer
Hope for what
   you may attain!


My love for you
   is strong and in it
I’m stricken     You
   are my desire


You are the full moon                            
   risen within me,
risen and never
   to decline

I Came to Know




Táyban gazelles entrance with glances,
      sword edges flashing bright


At Árafa I saw what she wanted
      and lost all patience there


We joined her late one night in Jem
      as foretold down the generations


A maiden’s oath is but a promise
      Don’t trust in one who’ll desert you


The wishes I was granted in Mína—                                  
      would they’d lasted till the end of time!


In Láʿlaʿ I was set aflame
      by one who shows the full moon rising


In Râma she searched, at Sába she burned,
      in Hājir she broke the seal


In Bāriq she saw the signs of lightning
      flash quicker than thought in the mind


The waters of Gháda were parched
      by desire aflame within me
